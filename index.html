                    <h2>Beginnings of detective fiction</h2>
                </header>

                <h3>In ancient literature</h3>
                <p>Some scholars, such as R. H. Pfeiffer, have suggested that certain ancient and religious texts bear
                    similarities to what would later be called detective fiction. In the Old Testament story of Susanna
                    and the Elders (the Protestant Bible locates this story within the apocrypha), the account told by
                    two witnesses broke down when Daniel cross-examines them. In response, author Julian Symons has
                    argued that "those who search for fragments of detection in the Bible and Herodotus are looking
                    only for puzzles" and that these puzzles are not detective stories. In the play Oedipus Rex by
                    Ancient Greek playwright Sophocles, the protagonist discovers the truth about his origins after
                    questioning various witnesses. Although "Oedipus's enquiry is based on supernatural, pre-rational
                    methods that are evident in most narratives of crime until the development of Enlightenment thought
                    in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries", this narrative has "all of the central
                    characteristics and formal elements of the detective story, including a mystery surrounding a
                    murder, a closed circle of suspects, and the gradual uncovering of a hidden past."</p>
                <h3>Estabilishment of the genre</h3>

                    <div class="img-caption">Edgar Allen Poe</div>
                </div>
                <p> Detective fiction in the English-speaking world is considered to have begun in 1841 with the
                    publication of Edgar Allan Poe's "The Murders in the Rue Morgue", featuring "the first fictional
                    detective,
                    the eccentric and brilliant C. Auguste Dupin". When the character first appeared, the word
                    detective did not even exist. However, the character's name, "Dupin", originated from the English
                    word dupe or deception. Poe devised a "plot formula that's been successful ever since, give or
                    take a few shifting variables."Poe followed with further Auguste Dupin tales: "The Mystery of
                    Marie Rogêt" in 1843 and "The Purloined Letter" in 1845.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Another early example of a whodunit is a subplot in the novel Bleak House (1853) by Charles Dickens.
                    The conniving lawyer Tulkinghorn is killed in his office late one night, and the crime is
                    investigated by Inspector Bucket of the Metropolitan police force. Numerous characters appeared on
                    the staircase leading to Tulkinghorn's office that night, some of them in disguise, and Inspector
                    Bucket must penetrate these mysteries to identify the murderer. Dickens also left a novel
                    unfinished at his death, The Mystery of Edwin Drood.</p>
                <p>Dickens's protégé, Wilkie Collins (1824–1889)—sometimes referred to as the "grandfather of English
                    detective fiction"—is credited with the first great mystery novel, The Woman in White. T. S. Eliot
                    called Collins's novel The Moonstone (1868) "the first, the longest, and the best of modern English
                    detective novels... in a genre invented by Collins and not by Poe", and Dorothy L. Sayers
                    called it "probably the very finest detective story ever written". The Moonstone contains a
                    number of ideas that have established in the genre several classic features of the 20th century
                    detective story:

                </div>

                <p>In 1887, Arthur Conan Doyle created Sherlock Holmes, arguably the most famous of all fictional
                    detectives. Although Sherlock Holmes is not the original fiction detective (he was influenced
                    by
                    Poe's Dupin and Gaboriau's Lecoq), his name has become a byword for the part. Conan Doyle
                    stated
                    that the character of Holmes was inspired by Dr. Joseph Bell, for whom Doyle had worked as a
                    clerk
                    at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing large conclusions
                    from
                    the smallest observations. A brilliant London-based "consulting detective" residing at 221B
                    Baker Street, Holmes is famous for his intellectual prowess and is renowned for his skillful
                    use of
                    astute observation, deductive reasoning, and forensic skills to solve difficult cases. Conan
                    Doyle
                    wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories featuring Holmes, and all but four stories are
                    narrated by Holmes's friend, assistant, and biographer, Dr. John H. Watson.</p>
