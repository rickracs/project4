                    <h2>Beginnings of detective fiction</h2>
                </header>

                <h3>In ancient literature</h3>
                <p>Some scholars, such as R. H. Pfeiffer, have suggested that certain ancient and religious texts bear
                    similarities to what would later be called detective fiction. In the Old Testament story of Susanna
                    and the Elders (the Protestant Bible locates this story within the apocrypha), the account told by
                    two witnesses broke down when Daniel cross-examines them. In response, author Julian Symons has
                    argued that "those who search for fragments of detection in the Bible and Herodotus are looking
                    only for puzzles" and that these puzzles are not detective stories. In the play Oedipus Rex by
                    Ancient Greek playwright Sophocles, the protagonist discovers the truth about his origins after
                    questioning various witnesses. Although "Oedipus's enquiry is based on supernatural, pre-rational
                    methods that are evident in most narratives of crime until the development of Enlightenment thought
                    in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries", this narrative has "all of the central
                    characteristics and formal elements of the detective story, including a mystery surrounding a
                    murder, a closed circle of suspects, and the gradual uncovering of a hidden past."</p>
                <h3>Estabilishment of the genre</h3>

                    <div class="img-caption">Edgar Allen Poe</div>
                </div>
                <p> Detective fiction in the English-speaking world is considered to have begun in 1841 with the
                    publication of Edgar Allan Poe's "The Murders in the Rue Morgue", featuring "the first fictional
                    detective,
                    the eccentric and brilliant C. Auguste Dupin". When the character first appeared, the word
                    detective did not even exist. However, the character's name, "Dupin", originated from the English
                    word dupe or deception. Poe devised a "plot formula that's been successful ever since, give or
                    take a few shifting variables."Poe followed with further Auguste Dupin tales: "The Mystery of
                    Marie Rogêt" in 1843 and "The Purloined Letter" in 1845.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Another early example of a whodunit is a subplot in the novel Bleak House (1853) by Charles Dickens.
                    The conniving lawyer Tulkinghorn is killed in his office late one night, and the crime is
                    investigated by Inspector Bucket of the Metropolitan police force. Numerous characters appeared on
                    the staircase leading to Tulkinghorn's office that night, some of them in disguise, and Inspector
                    Bucket must penetrate these mysteries to identify the murderer. Dickens also left a novel
                    unfinished at his death, The Mystery of Edwin Drood.</p>
                <p>Dickens's protégé, Wilkie Collins (1824–1889)—sometimes referred to as the "grandfather of English
                    detective fiction"—is credited with the first great mystery novel, The Woman in White. T. S. Eliot
                    called Collins's novel The Moonstone (1868) "the first, the longest, and the best of modern English
                    detective novels... in a genre invented by Collins and not by Poe", and Dorothy L. Sayers
                    called it "probably the very finest detective story ever written". The Moonstone contains a
                    number of ideas that have established in the genre several classic features of the 20th century
                    detective story:

                </div>

                <p>In 1887, Arthur Conan Doyle created Sherlock Holmes, arguably the most famous of all fictional
                    detectives. Although Sherlock Holmes is not the original fiction detective (he was influenced
                    by
                    Poe's Dupin and Gaboriau's Lecoq), his name has become a byword for the part. Conan Doyle
                    stated
                    that the character of Holmes was inspired by Dr. Joseph Bell, for whom Doyle had worked as a
                    clerk
                    at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing large conclusions
                    from
                    the smallest observations. A brilliant London-based "consulting detective" residing at 221B
                    Baker Street, Holmes is famous for his intellectual prowess and is renowned for his skillful
                    use of
                    astute observation, deductive reasoning, and forensic skills to solve difficult cases. Conan
                    Doyle
                    wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories featuring Holmes, and all but four stories are
                    narrated by Holmes's friend, assistant, and biographer, Dr. John H. Watson.</p>

                        <h2>Golden age detective novels</h2>
                    </header>
                <p>The period between World War I and World War II (the 1920s and 1930s) is generally referred to as
                    the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. During this period, a number of very popular writers
                    emerged, including mostly British but also a notable subset of American and New Zealand writers.
                    Female writers constituted a major portion of notable Golden Age writers. Agatha Christie, Dorothy
                    L. Sayers, Josephine Tey, Margery Allingham, and Ngaio Marsh were particularly famous female
                    writers of this time. Apart from Ngaio Marsh (a New Zealander), they were all British.</p>
                <p>The most widespread subgenre of the detective novel became the whodunit (or whodunnit, short for
                    "who done it?"). In this subgenre, great ingenuity may be exercised in narrating the crime, usually
                    a homicide, and the subsequent investigation. This objective was to conceal the identity of the
                    criminal from the reader until the end of the book, when the method and culprit are both revealed.</p>
                <p>
                    John Dickson Carr — who also wrote as Carter Dickson — used the “puzzle” approach in his writing
                    which was characterized by including a complex puzzle for the reader to try to unravel. He created
                    ingenious and seemingly impossible plots and is regarded as the master of the "locked room
                    mystery". Two of Carr’s most famous works are The Case of Constant Suicides (1941) and The Hollow
                    Man (1935)</p>

                <h3>Agatha Christie</h3>
                <p>Agatha Christie is not only the most famous Golden Age writer, but also considered one of the
                    most
                    famous authors of all genres of all time. At the time of her death in 1976, “she was the
                    best-selling
                    novelist in history.”</p>
                <p>Many of the most popular books of the Golden Age were written by Agatha Christie. She produced long
                    series of books featuring detective characters like Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, amongst others.
                    Her use of basing her stories on complex puzzles, “combined with her stereotyped characters and
                    picturesque middle-class settings”, is credited for her success. Christie's works include
                    Murder on the Orient Express (1934), Death on the Nile (1937), and And Then There Were None (1939).</p>
